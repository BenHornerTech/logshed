## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- Initial release of LogShed: lightweight, single-process log aggregator tailored for homelab environments.
- Dual ingestion engine:
  - Syslog server (UDP & TCP on port 1514) supporting RFC 3164 (BSD) and RFC 5424 (IETF) standards with transparent and octet-counted framing.
  - Docker Engine API collector streaming logs directly from `/var/run/docker.sock` (or TCP proxy).
- SQLite storage backend running in Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode with external-content FTS5 full-text search indexing.
- Keyed multi-line stream assembler grouping Python tracebacks and Java exceptions by source stream into single coherent log rows.
- Fast, virtualized real-time log dashboard built with React 18, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
- Multi-facet host and application filtering with full-text search syntax (`severity:error`, prefix wildcard queries).
- On-demand AI root-cause analysis supporting Google Gemini, OpenAI, and local LLMs (Ollama / vLLM / LocalAI).
- Automatic client-side and server-side credential/secret redaction (passwords, tokens, API keys, IP addresses) before AI dispatch.
- Dynamic Host Alias Manager allowing friendly IP-to-hostname mappings with retroactive updates across existing database rows.
- Automated daily database pruning worker with configurable log retention periods (default: 14 days, up to 365 days) and freelist reuse.
- Native multi-architecture container images (`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`).
- Unraid Community Applications template (`unraid-template.xml`) with cache-pool POSIX locking recommendations.
